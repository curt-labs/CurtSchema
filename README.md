CurtSchema
==========

This repository aims to centralize database schema files used by the Drone.io Continuous Integration (CI) server, which plays a very import part in how we are doing integration testing.

Prior to centralizing these files, there were data structure/consistency problems in the schema files. Some of these issues were: mismatched datatypes of columns, missing tables altogether, etc.
